# Image Stitching with SIFT Descriptor
This project demonstrates the use of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor for image stitching. The goal of image stitching is to combine multiple images with overlapping regions into a single panorama.
## Built With
OpenCV - The library used for image processing

## Acknowledgments
David Lowe's SIFT paper - The original SIFT descriptor paper

OpenCV's documentation - Used for reference while writing the code
